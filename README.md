# Biking Club

A bike club culture for people who love cycling in the city of Berlin. As the city is on average ten times larger than Paris, Berlin offers a huge urban playground for the discovery of hidden sites and for lovers of the abundant surrounding nature. We are an association of volunteers who will work for a physical and social balance within a flexible and stress-free structure.
